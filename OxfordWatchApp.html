								<h5>A Watch Application Design, created for Oxford University's students to help them keep track of their Grades, Timetable, receive University Communication and view their Profile.

                            <p>This is actually an interesting idea that I got through a <a href="https://sharpen.design/" target="_blank">Sharpen</a> prompt. Initally, I was a little skeptical about getting started with this project as I have never designed a visual appearance and interaction for a wearable device. I then told myself, "If I don't try to design one now, I will be limiting myself and I'll consider this an experiment to see how well I do it and whether I like doing it at all." and I started to sketch out the application on paper.</p>
                            
                            <p>The goal of the project is simple. This is a Watch-based application for students who attend Oxford University. I had to decide what goes into such an application as it should be direct and easy to understand and use. After thinking for a while, I decided that the app will have 4 main features. Viewing their class timetable, their grades, University communication and finally, their University profile containing details such as their Student ID Number, Date of Birth, etc.</p>
                            
                            <p>The main struggle stemmed from the fact that I have never used a wearable device before. Because of this, I had trouble figuring out how small or large the text should be to make it readable, the colours that I should use and even the size of the buttons. After looking at a few examples of existing Watch Apps, I got a rough idea but nothing concrete.</p>
                            
                            <p>After making a few sketches about how the buttons should be positioned and how the navigation is structured, I got a better idea on how to progress. I decided that I was going to prototype 3 features from the aforementioned list. The Grades, Timetable and E-Mail as logically, these 3 features will be the most used one by the students.</p>

                            <p>After this brainstorming session, I moved on to creating the High-Fidelity prototype on Figma. I chose Oxford Blue as the base colour of this application since it is the official colour of University of Oxford. Then I just <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank">Coolors</a>, a Colour Palette Generator to get fitting colours for the rest of the application such as the Greens for the Progress Bars, the Reds for Notifications and other colours I could use. </p>

                            <p>I had a lot of fun working on this project. Most importantly, I learnt how to design interactions for Smart Watches! I wanted the application to have a clean look to it as people only tend to look at their watch for a few seconds. I mainly concentrated on the usability of this application. I wanted users to understand the timetable and the mail communication in a very short amount of time.</p>
