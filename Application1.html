                                BookNest is a mobile application that allows users to borrow E-Books for a definitive period of time. A WishList function enables the users to add books they would like to read that are not available yet but when the book becomes available, will be notified via an E-Mail. The main goal of this application is to enable readers who do not have a lot of money to spare for books but would still like to read the titles they are interested in without any hassle. It is also a lot more convenient for users to read books from the comfort of their home rather than travel to a local library.

                                The main question is why would anyone use this application? Many Paperback Books and E-Books are relatively cheap nowadays and many consider books an investment since they do not perish. According to a study from the Pew Research Center on American reading habits, the number of books an average person reads a year is 12, although this number is inflated due to the number of avid readers who drive up the average. 
                            </p>
                            <p>    
                            Let us consider an example of a very famous book. The Design of Everyday Things by  Don Norman. This book costs $12.99 for Kindle and $14.18 for the Paperback version on Amazon. For someone who is working a full time job, this book is very inexpensive. But for a student who is on a budget, this might seem kind of expensive especially when they do not plan on re-reading it anytime soon because of their tight schedule. And what if the student we are talking about is an avid reader? The goal of this application is just to give users an opportunity to read books without actually having to buy it.                   
                            </p>

                                Before I get to designing the application, I wanted to settle on the direction of the design of the application. I created this MoodBoard to include certain style information such as the general colour scheme and font. I chose a Blue Colour scheme because the colour blue is proven to increase productivity as well as lower pulse rate, to ensure a great reading experience for the users. Although, overuse of the colour blue could decrease your appetite or worse, create a feeling of sadness which I definitely wanted to avoid.

                            <h2>Creating a Hypothesis Statement based on the User Persona of Tyrone Hayes</h2>
                            <p>If Tyrone downloads the app, he will have achieved his aim of finding an alternative way of reading books and arguably, a more reliable way than the local library. He will also be able to resolve his space issues in his dorm room and also, will not have to spend any money to read the books. We believe that easy access to the books will increase how frequently he uses the application which will most certainly be helpful for him to achieve his goal for becoming a successful author one day.</p>

                                Before I create the wireframes of the application, I have created a storyboard to visualise how Tyrone would navigate the application in order to borrow a book. I created this storyboard to visualise the organisation of screens in the wireframing phase.
