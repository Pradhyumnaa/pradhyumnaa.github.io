								<h1>Maple - A Printer Concept to Save The Earth</h1>
							</header>
							<div class="content" id="appintro">
								<h5>This is a concept for a printer that can recycle the paper that it prints. It is made by a fictional company called Printerra (Printer + Terra). The concept of the printer was conceived when I saw an old <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42JLXyJrFQQ" target="_blank">video</a></u> which showcases a printer concept that can erase ink using laser. This concept uses existing technologies and puts them together to create a very implementable solution to control paper wastage.</h5>

                            <hr class="lined">
                            <p>According to a few <a href="https://www.roadrunnerwm.com/blog/office-worker-waste-generation#:~:text=Even%20with%20the%20business%20world,of%20copy%20paper%20per%20year" target="_blank">studies</a>, the average employee uses 10,000 sheets of paper a year! <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/oct/14/workandcareers.news" target="_blank">Nearly, half of all printed documents are thrown away within 24 hours</a> and 30% are not even picked up from the printer. Of course, not every employee is the average employee mentioned above and there are some industries which require less paper usage but this also means that some industries use an insurmountable amount of paper each year. A more concerning fact is that approximately <a href="https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1393497" target="_blank">80% of filed paper is never looked at again.</a> Even though this paper might be important to retain confidential information for a period of time. This is worse when we consider the fact that most of these forms <a href="https://www.recordnations.com/2016/02/how-much-paper-is-used-in-one-day/" target="_blank">outdate themselves within 3 months</a>.</p>
                            
                            <h1>Existing Technology Used</h1>
                            <hr class="lined">
                            <p><a href="https://getrocketbook.com/products/rocketbook-core?variant=31416131534">Rocketbook</a> is a smart notebook which can connect to all the devices to share the scanned version of the notes you have written. The most interesting part about the book is that if you write using a specific pen <a href="http://pilotpen.us/brands/frixion/" target="_blank">(Pilot Frixion Line)</a>, you can erase whatever you wrote using the microfibre cloth they provide and a little water. Additionally, the paper is not made using paper! They are with with <a href="https://rocketbookhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016983573-Are-Rocketbook-Notebooks-Recyclable-#:~:text=Rocketbook%20notebooks%20consist%20of%20a,are%20made%20of%20this%20plastic." target="_blank">BPA poly-free plastic</a> which is recyclable.</p>

                            <hr class="lined">
                            <p>Now, imagine the paper which is being used to print is the same paper from Rocketbook. The ink cartridge is filled with the ink used in the Pilot Frixion pen. There is a feature in the printer which allows used paper to be inserted into it. The printer will then scan the page using the QR code present on the page which then digitizes the page. After this process, a strip of moist microfibre cloth can then move up and down to erase the contents of the page.</p>

                            <p>With all the advantages of this concept mentioned above, there are a few disadvantages that needs to be mentioned. Firsly, the cost of the paper itself is a lot higher than the standard A4 Sheet. A single sheet of an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JK-Copier-Paper-Sheets-Ream/dp/B00MVV81MK" target="_blank">A4 Sheet from JK Copier</a> costs approximately $0.06.
