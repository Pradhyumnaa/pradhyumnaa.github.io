                                The scope of this application is quite narrow. The main users of the applications would download the application to use its emulator functionality which allows them to play retro games on their mobile phones without having to worry about installing ROMs. These people could have an interest in older video games or could be playing it for the Nostalgia factor.

                            <p>To get a better understanding about how the users would traverse through the application, I have created a user journey of how Stephen Wallaker would navigate through the application and accomplish his goal of playing retro games and exchanging his high score points for rewards.</p>

                            <h2>Creating a Hypothesis Statement based on the User Persona of Stephen Wallaker</h2>
                            <p>If Stephen downloads the application, he will achieved his aim of finding a reliable way to play retro games on his mobile phone during his free time which is his primary goal for installing the application. Additionally, he would not have to worry about installing Emulators and ROMs on his mobile phone which is too complex of a task for him. We believe that this easy access to emulators will make him happier when he uses the application and will make him want to use it more often. (Albeit in a controlled amount, playing too much is not a good thing.)</p>

                            <p>
                                Before I create the wireframes of the application, I have created a storyboard to visualise how Stephen would navigate the application in order to play a game using the emulator functionality present in the application. I created this storyboard to visualise the organisation of screens in the wireframing phase.
                                
                            </p>

                                I have created a low-fidelity prototype for the application. For this Low-Fidelity Prototype, I focused more on the layout of the information on the screens rather than a specific user journey. This is because the user journey for getting to the emulator functionality is just 2 clicks away from the Home Screen. 
                            </p>

                            <p>I did stumble across an issue when designing the history page of the application which tracks the scores they got when playing the emulator, sorted by date and time. For this screen, I had two different layout ideas of which I have posted pictures of below.</p>
                            
                            <img id = "journey" class="imgcontent" src="images/Arcade_Application/History.jpg" alt="journey" style="width:25%">
                            
                            <img id = "journey" class="imgcontent" src="images/Arcade_Application/History%20Alternative.jpg" alt="journey" style="width:25%">
                            
                            <br><br>
                            
                            <p>In my opinion, Layout 1 is easier for the users to understand since users are used to seeing the history page arranged similarly (Such as the Search History in Google Chrome). If I do follow the  Design Heuristic which specifies that the designers should go for recognition over recall, I would choose Layout 1.</p>
