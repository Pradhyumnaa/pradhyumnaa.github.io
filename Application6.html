                            <p>This is a mobile application concept for a bicycle shop based in Montreal. The users will be able to rent all types of bicycles, buy bikes as well as customise them according to their needs.</p>
                            
                            <h1>Defining the Users of the Application and it's Scope</h1>

                                This application can have many types of users. One category of users would be the ones who mainly download it for the renting aspect of the application. The other category would be the ones who mainly use it to buy bikes and buy parts to customise it according to their use cases. Since both parts of the application are equally important, user should be able to access both functionalities without much hassle and be able to switch between them seamlessly.

                            <p>To get a better understanding about how the users would traverse through the application, I have created a user journey of how Harvey Stokes would navigate through the application and accomplish his goal of renting a bike to commute to University. </p>

                            <h2>Creating a Hypothesis Statement based on the User Persona of Harvey Stokes</h2>
                            <p>If Harvey downloads the app, he will have achieved his aim of finding an alternative way to work which is his primary goal for installing the application. Additionally, his concern of not getting enough exercise is also fulfilled to some extent. We believe that easy access to the bikes of all kinds for Harvey will increase the frequency at which he uses the application which will be good for him and additionally, the environment (Not the primary goal of the application but a welcome one at that).</p>

                                Before I create the wireframes of the application, I have created two storyboards, one illustrating where the users would use the application and another depicting how the users would interact with the application. I thought doing this would give me a clearer understand of how the wireframes should be organised.

                                I have created a low-fidelity prototype for the application. For this Low-Fidelity Prototype, I focused on the main user journey of the application which covers signing in, picking a bike to rent, renting it, then ending the ride and finally, paying for it. Since the renting feature is going to be the most used one statistically, this was the user journey I wanted to focus on more than the buying and customisation part of the application.
